# Keywords Report In PDFs
Generates an Excel output report of what keywords are found in PDF files. Assumes you have a set of PDF files in a folder with a list of keywords that you're looking for in a spreadsheet. 

Uses Azure FormRecognizer for processing the PDFs so you need to have a key for that.
